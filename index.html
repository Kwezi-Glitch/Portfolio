                Hello, my name is Kwezi Mubarak and welcome to the first draft of my portfolio site. I am a first year Software Engineering student pursuing a Higher Diploma in Software Engineering (HDSE) at Aptech Computer Education. <br>
                My journey in this vast field of IT and it's technologies is about one year long so far and I am enjoying every single second. Currently, my knowledge lies in the following areas; I have learned Low-level programming in C and C++ and Front-end web design using HTML5 and CSS. <br>
                Haha, sorry if you expected some fancy fancy geeky or top notch programmer's stuff. Well basically  am still at the learning stage but luckily with a high implementation level. <br>
                That is all I have for you now. See you on the other side!!!
